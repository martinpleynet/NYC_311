I downloaded the New York City 311 Service requests data with the aim of evaluating the difference in response time to complaints filed by zipcode. Upon downloading the data, I only kept complaints filed in the year 2020 that had been closed (i.e. closed date value was not null). I proceeded to calculate the length in days it took to respond to each complaint. Some lengths were negative, and I filtered those out. Once I finished cleaning and filtering the dataset to its desired form, I calculated the average response time per month by each zipcode, as well as the overall average by month to be able to compare individual zipcodes not only to each other but to the entire city. I preprocessed all of the averages to allow for fast refresh times of the dashboard when new zipcodes would be selected in the dropdown menu. 

Next, I used Bokeh to build a dashboard which displayed 3 lines on a plot. Two lines would graph the service time averages by month for given user selected zipcodes from a dropdown menu, and the final line would remain fixed to display the the overall service time averages by month. Futhermore, I made it so that the dashboard would authenticate any user who logs in using a specific username and password in the url parameters. Once a user was authenticated, they could view this dashboard. The dashboard was run from an AWS EC2 instance.
